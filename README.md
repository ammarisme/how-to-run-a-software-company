Disclaimer:
This is an ongoing project. Which means, until we have a version available, there will be incremental improvements to the content.

The most recent build of the book-project is here - https://github.com/ammarisme/how-to-run-a-software-company/blob/main/Compiled%20Book.pdf

What this book-project is about.?
- This is a technical guide. This isn't a book where you'd find step by step instructions on how you should implement things in a software company. But rather a set of things you need to have to run a smoother software development operation.
- Content you'd find here are biased. Which means, to implement certain practices we've used particular technologies. For example, for version we are using git/github. This is a very biased choice. The same principles we talk about in the book can be applied using other tools as well.

Few things you must know,
- This book-project is still in it's skeleton stage where I'd add topics and bullet points per chapter. If you want to contribute, feel free to clone, edit, commit and put a PR.

Book Project vs Book
- A book-project is a continuous work where you'd see improvements time to time. A book is something that is written at once and never changed until the next edition. Probably never rewritten even if industries change.
- A book-project belongs to a community. Whereas a book solely belongs to the author.
